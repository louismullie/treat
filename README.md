Treat is a framework for natural language processing and computational linguistics in Ruby. It provides a common API for a number of gems and external libraries for document retrieval, parsing, annotation, and information extraction.

**Current features**

* Text extractors for PDF, HTML, XML, Word, AbiWord, OpenOffice and image formats (Ocropus).
* Text retrieval with indexation and full-text search (Ferret).
* Text chunkers, sentence segmenters, tokenizers, and parsers (Stanford & Enju).
* Word inflectors, including stemmers, conjugators, declensors, and number inflection.
* Lexical resources (WordNet interface, several POS taggers for English).
* Language, date/time, topic words (LDA) and keyword (TF*IDF) extraction.
* Serialization of annotated entities to YAML, XML or to MongoDB.
* Visualization in ASCII tree, directed graph (DOT) and tag-bracketed (standoff) formats.
* Linguistic resources, including language detection and tag alignments for several treebanks.
* Machine learning (decision tree, multilayer perceptron, linear, support vector machines).
